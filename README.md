ExtTube is a Tampermonkey userscript that adds a **Watch on Invidious** button to YouTube videos while keeping the default YouTube player. This allows users to easily open videos on an Invidious instance for a more privacy-friendly experience, or if the YouTube site has problems loading videos (which is the reason why I made this).

## Features
âœ… Adds a **Watch on Invidious** button below YouTube videos  
âœ… Keeps the default YouTube player  
âœ… Lightweight and fast  

## Installation

## How It Works
- The script runs automatically on YouTube.
- It adds a **Watch on Invidious** button next to the like/dislike buttons.
- Clicking the button opens the current video in Invidious in a new tab.
