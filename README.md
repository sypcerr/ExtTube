**ExtTube** is a Tampermonkey userscript that **replaces the default YouTube player** with an enhanced player. This allows users to use a diffrent YouTube Player if the YouTube site has problems loading Videos (which is the reason why I made this).

## Features
- âœ… Replaces the default YouTube player with a **privacy-friendly Invidious player**  
- âœ… Keeps the YouTube experience with **all functionalities intact**  
- âœ… Lightweight and fast 

## Installation
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) if you haven't already.
2. Click the button below to install ExtTube.

## How It Works
- The script runs automatically on YouTube.
- It adds a **Watch on Invidious** button next to the like/dislike buttons.
- Clicking the button opens the current video in Invidious in a new tab.
